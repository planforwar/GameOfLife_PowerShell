# TheGameOfLife.ps1
This is my first attempt at simulating Conway's the game of life in powershell.
There are certain problems with the code currently.
1. The code has a pre-defined initial state. This can be changed by editing the 
   sample filler code in the Main function.
2. The Get-NextGeneration function is taking about 10.5 secs.

## Setup
Copy the code into a file called 'TheGameOfLife.ps1'

## Execution
`.\TheGameOfLife.ps1`
